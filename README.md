# Hotel-Ratings-Predictions  - Comparison of SVM, Logistic Regression and RNN 

The project contains the code for predicting hotel ratings based on reviews. The ratings are marked on a scale of 1-5. 
By comapring the models, the results show RNN did not outperform SVM and Logistic Regression. However a further 
tuning is required to evaluate the results more accurately. 

# Data

The dataset can be accessed through Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/lpuglisi/predicting-hotel-rating-from-reviews. 
The dataset is aprt of an ogoing competition fot hotel ratings predictions by comparing different machine learning models.
